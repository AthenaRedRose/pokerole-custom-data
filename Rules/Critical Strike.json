  "flavor": "Hit 'em right between the legs!",
  "text": "A critical strike occurs when you roll at least three 6 during an accuracy check (You need only 2 for 'High Critical' moves). After adding STAB, super effective and item modifiers, multiply the Total by 1.5 and round up; resistance and defenses are calculated after multiplication. If the move applies stat boosts or reductions, those will be increased by 1.",
  "example": "An Oshawott gets a critical on their use of Water Gun against a Chimchar with 1 Special Defense. They roll 4 successes on their damage roll, so add +1 from STAB and +1 for SE damage for a total of 6. Then they multiply that total by 1.5.\n6 Ã— 1.5 = 9\nAfter defense and resistance, the Chimchar will take 8 damage from that critical Water Gun."
