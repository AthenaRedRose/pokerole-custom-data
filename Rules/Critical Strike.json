  "text": "A critical strike occurs when you roll at least three 6 during an accuracy check (You need only 2 for 'High Critical' moves). After the damage reduction from defense, the damage dealt will be increased by 50%, rounded up. If the move applies stat boosts or reductions, those will be increased by 1.",
  "example": "You crit and successfully roll 5 damage dies. Your enemy has 2 defense. The final damage dealt is (5 - 2) * 1.5 = 4.5, so 5 damage."
