  "name": "Multi-Target and Area moves",
  "flavor": "Watch out, it's the 'Oops, I Did It Everywhere' attack!",
  "text": "- Moves targeting **All Foes**: Declare the order in which your character focuses on your enemies.\n- Moves targeting **Area**: Use `/select_random` to determine the order in which the combatants are hit. These moves target *everyone* except the user.\n\nIn both cases, only the first target can receive a critical hit, and for every successive target hit, reduce the damage die count by 1. There is *no* target limit.",
  "example": "You are using Razor Leaf against three foes! First, you declare the order in which they are to be hit: Ursaring, Absol, Sneasler. Then, you roll accuracy. It's a crit, yay! Roll your regular 6 damage dies against the Ursaring. Critical damage will be applied! Then, roll 5 damage dies against the Lucario. Finally, 4 dies against the Sneasler. Both of those take the regular damage without crit modifiers."
