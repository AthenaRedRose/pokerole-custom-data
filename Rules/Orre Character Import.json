And no items or other unlocks can be carried over.\nIt is fine to start out as an evolved mon here, just check `/rule name:Evolution` for the details.\nJust follow the character creation guide and apply your two level ups afterwards, those will yield you one Combat Stat Point each and promote you to silver, which also yields two extra Social Stat points!",
