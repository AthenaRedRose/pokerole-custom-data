  "name": "Accuracy Reduction",
  "flavor": "Got a little bit of dirt in your eye?",
  "text": "Characters afflicted by accuracy reduction (either as a stat change or through a move effect) still roll the regular amount of accuracy dies, but then subtract -X from the amount of successes this roll had.",
  "example": "Let's say you want to use Rock Slide. The move has a -1 Accuracy effect. You roll your regular Dex+Rank amount of dies for your accuracy and land two successes. Now we reduce those successes by -1... which leaves us with one success, so the attack still hits, yay!"
