  "text": "A Held Item is assigning 1 item in their Inventory as a a Held Item, which can allow the user to use their held effects, or can allow for consumable items to be used other then a Free Action. All you have to do is assign an Item in your bag as a 'Held' item, and it'll be considered as such.\nNormally a Held Item can be obtained through quests, trading, and purchases from various shops. Their passive effects are only active when Held in your inventory.\nOut of combat, you may freely change which item is your currently held one, however during combat you must use your Action in order to do so.\nIf you hold a Consumable Item as your Held Item, you have a few more options other then using it as Free Action on your turn. On your turn, you can use your Action to use your Held Consumable, and then your Free Action to use another Consumable. When certain types of berries are held (Damage Resist, Status Immunities) the corresponding effects are immediately negated.",
  "example": " A Basculegion is fighting a Haxorus, each one holding a Held Item. The Basculegion is holding an Ice Plate, an Item that increases the damage of Ice Moves. They use Ice Fang towards the Haxorus, but they themselves are holding a Yache Berry, a berry that reduces Ice Type Damage. Since it's a held item, they're able to survive the hit, and on their turn, they use their Action to switch to change their Held Item to a Life Orb. And so the battle rages on!"
