  "name": "Charge Move",
  "flavor": "True power takes time!",
  "text": "Moves labeled with Charge are moves that need a turn to get ready. You start out by calling the move and rolling accuracy to see if it hits. If you fail; your turn is skipped as normal. If you succeed; you must wait until the next turn. At the start of the next round, you use the same exact initiative result you'd the round prior (you cannot stall during the charge of a Charge Move, taking priority over anyone who rolls the same number. Once your turn comes up, roll the damage as normal and that turn is finished as well.",
  "example": "An Excadrill is fighting a Bayleaf and a Raticate. The Excadrill rolls a 7 on initiative, the Bayleaf a 5 and the Raticate a 3. Excadrill uses Dig and succeeds their accuracy roll, Bayleaf used Solar Beam and also succeeded. The Raticate passes their turn. The next round starts and the Raticate rolls an 8. Despite the Excadrill emerging before the Bayleaf and their strong attack, they can do nothing about this and must use their previous initiative. Excadrill and Bayleaf's initiative was already set the round prior so it goes Raticate (8), Excadrill (7) and Bayleaf (5). The Raticate does nothing once more while the Excadrill attacks said Raticate with Dig and ends their turn. The Bayleaf attacks the newly emerged Excadrill with Solar Beam and defeats them. Tough luck."
