  "name": "Evolution",
  "flavor": "Sometimes they just grow a little too fast!",
  "text": "You can evolve at any time or even start out as a fully evolved pokemon, but as long as you haven't reached the level required for your evolution yet, you will have to play with the base stats and moves of your unevolved form. Evolution thresholds are Level 3 for second stage, and Level 6 for third stage evolutions. In severe cases where even the second evo has terrible stats, such as for e.g. the Weedle/Kakuna/Beedrill line, you may apply for an exception to be made.\nIf you want to have your evolution happen under specific circumstances, feel free to hit up any Quest Giver to create an evo-quest for you!\n\nCharacters who wish to not evolve upon reaching the required rank might choose to do so as well, and still receive the stats and most of the moves the evolved pokemon would have (not the abilities, though)! Think of it as an upgraded 'plus' version. This also does not lock you out from evolving at a later point!",
  "example": "Let's say you want to play a Tyranitar. Pupitar is probably not the most fun to play, so you decide to start out fully evolved right from the get go. Until level 3 you will have to play with the base stats and moves of a Larvitar. Once you reach level 3, you can upgrade your base stats and moves to that of a Pupitar, and, finally, once you reach level 6, your base stats and moves may reflect those of a full-powered Tyranitar!"
